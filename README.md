## Practice for Algorithms and Data Structures II. Implementation of classic algorithms and data structures in C++11

Data structures implemented:
  * Splay Tree
  * Hash Map (with open addressing)
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Heap

The idea of this repository is to provide implementations of classic algorithms in C++11, with examples of how to build iterators, and use C++ operators like the STL.
I followed most of the conventions specified in the Google C++ Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
